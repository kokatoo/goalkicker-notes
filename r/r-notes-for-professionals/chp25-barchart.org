* Chapter 25: Bar Chart

  The purpose of the bar plot is to display the frequencies (or proportions) of
  levels of a factor variable. For example, a bar plot is used to pictorially
  display the frequencies (or proportions) of individuals in various
  socio-economic (factor) groups(levels-high, middle, low). Such a plot will
  help to provide a visual comparison among the various factor levels.

** Section 25.1: barplot() function

   In barplot, factor-levels are placed on the x-axis and frequencies (or
   proportions) of various factor-levels are considered on the y-axis. For each
   factor-level one bar of uniform width with heights being proportional to
   factor level frequency (or proportion) is constructed.

   The ~barplot()~ function is in the graphics package of the R's System
   Library. The ~barplot()~ function must be supplied at least one argument. The
   R help calls this as heights, which must be either vector or a matrix. If it
   is vector, its members are the various factor-levels.

   To illustrate ~barplot()~, consider the following data preparation:

#+begin_src R
  > grades <- c("A+", "A-", "B+", "B", "C")
  > Marks <- sample(grades, 40, replace=T, prob=c(.2, .3, .25, .15, .1))
  > Marks
  [1] "A+" "A-" "B+" "A-" "A+" "B" "A+" "B+" "A-" "B" "A+" "A-"
  [13] "A-" "B+" "A-" "A-" "A-" "A-" "A+" "A-" "A+" "A+" "C" "C"
  [25] "B" "C" "B+" "C" "B+" "B+" "B+" "A+" "B+" "A-" "A+" "A-"
  [37] "A-" "B" "C" "A+"
#+end_src

   A bar chart of the ~Marks~ vector is obtained from

#+begin_src R
  > barplot(table(Marks), main="Mid-Marks in Algorithms")
#+end_src

   Notice that, the ~barplot()~ function places the factor levels on the x-axis
   in the lexicographical ~order~ of the levels. Using the parameter
   ~names.arg~, the bars in plot can be placed in the order as stated in the
   vector, ~grades~.

#+begin_src R
  # plot to the desired horizontal axis labels
  > barplot(table(Marks), names.arg=grades, main="Mid-Marks in Algorithms")
#+end_src

[[./images/chp25.1_marks2.png]]

   Colored bars can be drawn using the ~col=~ parameter.

#+begin_src R
  > barplot(table(Marks), names.arg=grades,
            col=c("lightblue", "lightcyan", "lavender", "mistyrose", "cornsilk"),
            main="Mid-Marks in Algorithms")
#+end_src

[[./images/chp25.1_marks3.png]]

   A bar chart with horizontal bars can be obtained as follows:

#+begin_src R
  > barplot(table(Marks), names.arg=grades, horiz=TRUE,
            col=c("lightblue", "lightcyan", "lavender", "mistyrose", "cornsilk"),
            main="Mid-Marks in Algorithms")
#+end_src

[[./images/chp25.1_marks4.png]]

   A bar chart with proportions on the y-axis can be obtained as follows:

#+begin_src R
  > barplot(prop.table(table(Marks)), names.arg=grades,
            col=c("lightblue", "lightcyan", "lavender", "mistyrose", "cornsilk"),
            main="Mid-Marks in Algorithms")
#+end_src

[[./images/chp25.1_marks5.png]]

   The sizes of the factor-level names on the x-axis can be increased using ~cex.names~ parameter.

#+begin_src R
> barplot(prop.table(table(Marks)),names.arg=grades,col = c("lightblue", "lightcyan", "lavender", "mistyrose", "cornsilk"), main="Mid-Marks in Algorithms",cex.names=2)
#+end_src

   The ~heights~ parameter of the ~barplot()~ could be a matrix. For example it
   could be matrix, where the columns are the various subjects taken in a
   course, the rows could be the labels of the grades. Consider the following
   matrix:

#+begin_src R
  > gradTab
     Algorithms Operating Systems Discrete Math
  A-         13                10             7
  A+         10                 7             2
  B           4                 2            14
  B+          8                19            12
  C           5                 2             5
#+end_src

   To draw a stacked bar, simply use the command:

#+begin_src R
  > gradTab = matrix(c(13, 10, 4, 8, 5, 10, 7, 2, 19, 2, 7, 2, 14, 12, 5), nrow=5,
                     dimnames=list(c("A-", "A+", "B", "B+", "C"),
                                   c("Algorithms", "Operating Systems", "Discrete Math"))
  > barplot(gradTab, col=c("lightblue", "lightcyan", "lavender", "mistyrose", "cornsilk"),
            legend.text=grades,
            main="Mid-Marks in Algorithms")
#+end_src

[[./images/chp25.1_marks6.png]]

   To draw a juxtaposed bars, use the ~besides~ parameter, as given under:

#+begin_src R
  > barplot(gradTab, beside=T, col=c("lightblue","lightcyan", "lavender", "mistyrose", "cornsilk"),
            legend.text=grades, main="Mid-Marks in Algorithms")
#+end_src

[[./images/chp25.1_marks7.png]]

   A horizontal bar chart can be obtained using ~horiz=T~ parameter:

#+begin_src R
  > barplot(gradTab, beside=T, horiz=T, col=c("lightblue","lightcyan", "lavender", "mistyrose", "cornsilk"),
            legend.text = grades,
            cex.names=.75,
            main="Mid-Marks in Algorithms")
#+end_src
