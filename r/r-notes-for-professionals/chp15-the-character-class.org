* Chapter 15: The character class

  Characters are what other languages call 'string vectors.'

** Section 15.1: Coercion

   To check whether a value is a character use the ~is.character()~ function. To
   coerce a variable to a character use the ~as.character()~ function.

#+begin_src R
   x <- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

   class(x)
   [1] "character"
   is.character(x)
   [1] TRUE
#+end_src

   Note that numerics can be coerced to characters, but attempting to coerce a
   character to numeric may result in NA.

#+begin_src R
  as.numeric("2")
  [1] 2

  as.numeric("fox")
  [1] NA
  Warning message:
  NAs introduced by coercion
#+end_src
