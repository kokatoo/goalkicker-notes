*** Problem A1

    Calculate the chi-square statistic and degrees of freedom for the following
    set of data for 300 elders exposed to different interventions to encourage
    flu shots:

| Flu Shot Status         | Group A | Group B | Group C | Total |
|-------------------------+---------+---------+---------+-------|
| Had a flu shot          |      20 |      45 |      25 |    90 |
| Did not have a flu shot |      80 |      55 |      75 |   210 |
| Total                   |     100 |     100 |     100 |   300 |

    Is the value of chi-square statistically significant at the .05 level? Based
    on the (O â«º E)2/E components contributing to chi-square, comment on the
    nature of the relationship between groups and flu shot status.

#+begin_src R
mytable <- as.table(
  matrix(c(20, 80, 45, 55, 25, 75),
    nrow = 2,
    dimnames = list(c("flu-shot", "no-flu-shot"),
                    c("GroupA", "GroupB", "GroupC"))
  )
)

fit <- chisq.test(mytable)
> fit

	Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  mytable
X-squared = 16.667, df = 2, p-value = 0.0002404

df <- (nrow(mytable) - 1) * (ncol(mytable) - 1)
freq_ratios <- (fit$observed - fit$expected)^2 / fit$expected

> freq_ratios
               GroupA    GroupB    GroupC
flu-shot    3.3333333 7.5000000 0.8333333
no-flu-shot 1.4285714 3.2142857 0.3571429

*** Problem A3

    Using the statistical information from the first two exercises, write a
    paragraph summarizing the results of the analyses.

    The 3 groups differed significantly. For example, Groups B's rate of
    obtaining a flu shot is substantially higher than expected.

*** Problem A4

    Given each of the following situations, determine whether the calculated
    values of chi-square are statistically significant:

    (a) chisq = 3.72, df = 1, alpha = .05
    (b) chisq = 9.59, df = 4, alpha = .05 
    (c) chisq = 10.67, df = 3, alpha = .01 
    (d) chisq = 9.88, df = 2, alpha = .01

#+begin_src R
> 1 - pchisq(3.72, 1)
[1] 0.05376437

> 1 - pchisq(9.59, 4)
[1] 0.04793044

> 1 - pchisq(10.67, 3)
[1] 0.01365094

> 1 - pchisq(9.88, 1)
[1] 0.001670849

*** Problem A5

    Assume that a researcher has conducted a pilot intervention study and wants
    to use the pilot results to estimate the number of participants needed in a
    full-scale study to achieve a power of .80 with alpha = .05. For each of the
    hypothetical pilot results presented below, how many study participants in
    each group would be needed in the larger study? (Note that in using Table 3,
    it makes no difference which of two groups is considered Group 1 or Group
    2.)

    (a) Experimental group: 45%, Control group: 65%
    (b) Experimental group: 15%, Control group: 5%
    (c) Experimental group: 20%, Control group: 35%
    (d) Experimental group: 60%, Control group: 75%

*** Problem A6

    Match each of the nonparametric tests in Column A with its parametric
    counterpart in Column B:

| Nonparametric Test         | Parametric Test           |
|----------------------------+---------------------------|
| Mann-Whitney U Test        | Independent groups t-test |
| Friedman Test              | RM ANOVA                  |
| Kruskal-Wallis Test        | One-way ANOVA             |
| Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test | Paired t-test             |

*** Problem A7

    Using the information provided, indicate which test you think should be used
    for each of the following situations:

    (a) Independent variable: normal birthweight versus low birthweight infants;
    dependent variable: 1-minute Apgar scores (0 to 10 scale); sample size:
    eight infants per group

    Mann-Whitney U test

    (b) Independent variable: time of measurement (before, during, and after
    surgery); dependent variable: heart rate; sample size: 80

    RM-ANOVA

    (c) Independent variable: time of measurement (before, during, and after
    intervention); dependent variable: did versus did not exercise daily; sample
    size: 30

    Cochran's Q

    (d) Independent variable: infertility treatment A versus infertility
    treatment B versus control condition; dependent variable: did versus did
    not become pregnant; sample size: 180

    Chi-square test for independence

    (e) Independent variable: Drug A versus Drug B versus placebo; dependent
    variable: pain measured on a 0 to 10 scale; sample size: nine per group

    Kruskal-Wallis test

    (f) Independent variable: role (elderly parent versus adult child);
    dependent variable: preference for nursing home placement versus home care
    for parent

    McNemar test
