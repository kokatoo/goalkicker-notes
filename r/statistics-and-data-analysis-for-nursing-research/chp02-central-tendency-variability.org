  Outliers are often identified in relation to the value of a distributionâ€™s
  IQR. By convention, a mild outlier is a data value that lies between 1.5x and
  3.0x the IQR below Q1 or above Q3. An extreme outlier is a data value that is
  more that 3x the IQR below Q1 or above Q3.

*** Problem A1

    The following numbers represent the scores of 30 psychi- atric inpatients on
    a widely used measure of depression (the Center for Epidemiologic
    Studies-Depression scale). What are the mean, the median, and the mode for
    these data?

    The data is slight skew to the right.

#+begin_src R
data <- c(41, 27, 32, 24, 21, 28, 22, 25, 35, 27, 31, 40, 23,
          27, 29, 33, 42, 30, 26, 30, 27, 39, 26, 34, 28, 38,
          29, 36, 24, 37)

stats <- psych::describe(data)

> stats$mean
[1] 30.36667

> stats$median
[1] 29

> as.numeric(names(which.max(table(data))))
[1] 27
#+end_src

*** Problem A2

    Find the medians for the following distributions:

#+begin_src R
> median(c(1, 5, 7, 8, 9))
[1] 7
> median(c(3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10))
[1] 7
> median(c(3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 20))
[1] 4
> median(c(2, 4, 5, 5, 8, 9))
[1] 5
#+end_src

*** Problem A3

    For which distribution in question A2 would the median be preferred to the
    mean as the index of central tendency? Why?

    Distribution c has an extreme value of 20.

#+begin_src R
> boxplot(c(3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 20))$out
[1] 20
#+end_src

*** Problem A4

    The following ten data values are systolic blood pressure readings. Compute
    the mean, the range, the SD, and the variance for these data.

#+begin_src R
data <- c(130, 110, 160, 120, 170, 120, 150, 140, 160, 140)

> as.data.frame(psych::describe(data.frame(data)))[c("mean", "range", "sd")]
   mean range sd
X1  140    60 20

> var(data)
[1] 400
#+end_src

*** Problem A5

    For each blood pressure value in question A4, compute a z score. Then,
    transform these z scores to standard scores with a mean of 500 and an SD
    of 100.

#+begin_src R
zscores <- scale(data)[, 1]

> cbind(data, zscores, transformed = zscores * 100 + 500)
      data zscores transformed
 [1,]  130    -0.5         450
 [2,]  110    -1.5         350
 [3,]  160     1.0         600
 [4,]  120    -1.0         400
 [5,]  170     1.5         650
 [6,]  120    -1.0         400
 [7,]  150     0.5         550
 [8,]  140     0.0         500
 [9,]  160     1.0         600
[10,]  140     0.0         500
