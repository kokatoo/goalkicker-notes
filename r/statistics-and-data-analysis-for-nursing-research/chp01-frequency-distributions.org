** Skewness and Kurtosis

   As a rough guide, a skewness or kurtosis index that is more than twice the
   value of its standard error can be interpreted as a departure from symmetry.

** Data Transformation

   ~k~ is a value from which each score is subtracted, such that the smallest
   score = 1; ~k~ is set equal to the highest score value in the distribution ~+
   1~

| Problem                    | Type of Transformation       | Function       |
|----------------------------+------------------------------+----------------|
| Positive skew, moderate    | Square root                  | ~sqrt(x)~      |
| Positive skew, substantial | Base 10 logarithmic          | ~log10(x)~     |
| Positive skew, severe      | Inverse                      | ~1 / x~        |
| Negative skew, moderate    | Reversed square root         | ~sqrt(k - x)~  |
| Negative skew, substantial | Reversed base 10 logarithmic | ~log10(k - x)~ |
| Negative skew, severe      | Reversed inverse             | ~1 / (k- x)~   |

** Exercises

*** Problem A1

    Construct a frequency distribution for this set of data, showing the absolute
    frequencies, relative frequencies, and cumulative relative frequencies.

#+begin_src R
mydata <- "0 3 4 1 0 2 0 1 2 0 1 0 0 1 2 5 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 0 1 1 3 2 1 0 1 3 1 1 0 4 6 1 0 1"

mydata <- lapply(strsplit(mydata, " "), as.integer)[[1]]

mytable <- table(mydata)

mytable <-
  rbind(
    "Freq" = mytable,
    "%" = prop.table(mytable) * 100,
    "Cum %" = cumsum(prop.table(mytable)) * 100
  )

mytable <- rbind("Num of Falls" = as.integer(colnames(mytable)),
                 mytable)

falls <- as.data.frame(t(mytable))
> falls
  Num of Falls Freq    % Cum %
0            0   13 32.5  32.5
1            1   15 37.5  70.0
2            2    5 12.5  82.5
3            3    3  7.5  90.0
4            4    2  5.0  95.0
5            5    1  2.5  97.5
6            6    1  2.5 100.0
#+end_src

*** Problem A2
    
    Using information from the frequency distribution for Exercise A1, answer
    the following:

    1. What percentage of the nursing home residents had at least one fall?

#+begin_src R
> sum(falls[falls[, "Num of Falls"] > 0, "%"]) 
[1] 67.5
#+end_src

    2. What number of falls was the most frequent in this sample?

#+begin_src R
> falls[falls$Freq == max(falls[, "Freq"]), ]
  Num of Falls Freq    % Cum %
1            1   15 37.5    70
#+end_src
    
    3. What number of falls was the least frequent in this sample?

#+begin_src R
> falls[falls$Freq == min(falls[, "Freq"]), ]
  Num of Falls Freq   % Cum %
5            5    1 2.5  97.5
6            6    1 2.5 100.0
#+end_src

    4. What percentage of residents had two or fewer falls?

#+begin_src R
> sum(falls[falls["Num of Falls"] <= 2, "%"])
[1] 82.5
#+end_src

    5. What is the total size of the sample?

#+begin_src R
> sum(falls[, "Freq"])
[1] 40
#+end_src

    6. Are there any outliers in this dataset?
    
#+begin_src R
> boxplot(mydata)$out
[1] 6
#+end_src
    
*** Problem A3

    Draw a frequency histogram for the data shown in Exercise A1. Now
    superimpose a frequency polygon on the histogram.

#+begin_src R
hist(
  mydata,
  breaks = -1:6,
  xlab = "Num of Falls",
  col = "red",
  main = "Falls"
)
lines(seq(-0.5, 5.5), falls$Freq)
#+end_src

*** Problem A4

    Describe the shape of the frequency distribution drawn in Exercise A3 in
    terms of modality and skewness. Is the number of falls normally distributed?

    Unimodal, positively skewed and not normally distributed.

#+begin_src R
> as.data.frame(psych::describe(mydata))[c("se", "skew", "kurtosis")]
     se skew kurtosis
X1 0.23 1.36     1.38
#+end_src

*** Problem A5

    If you wanted to display information on patientsâ€™ age using the data in
    Table 5, would you construct a histogram, bar graph, frequency polygon, or
    pie chart? Defend your selection, and then construct such a graph.

#+begin_src R
age <- "
25to34 35to44 45to54 55to64 greater65
20 31 44 30 13
"

age <- read.table(text = age, header = TRUE)

barplot(as.matrix(age),
  xlab = "Age Group",
  ylab = "Counts"
)
#+end_src
