*** Problem A1

    What is the probability of drawing a spade from a normal, shuffled deck of
    52 cards? What is the probability of drawing five spades in a row (i.e., the
    probability of getting a flush in five-card poker)?

#+begin_src R
## Prob of drawing a spade
1 / 4

## Prob of drawing 5 spades
> 0.25^5

*** Problem A3

    Given a normal distribution of scores with a mean of 100 and an SD of 10,
    compute z scores for the following score values: 95, 115, 80, and 130.

#+begin_src R
scores <- c(95, 115, 80, 130)

> (scores - 100) / 10
[1] -0.5  1.5 -2.0  3.0

*** Problem A4

    Based on Figure 2, which shows a normal distribution of childrenâ€™s heights
    with a mean of 60.0 and an SD of 5.0, approximately what is the probability
    of randomly selecting a child whose height is less than 50 inches?

#+begin_src R
> pnorm(50, mean = 60, sd = 5)
[1] 0.0228

> pnorm((50 - 60) / 5)
[1] 0.0228
#+end_src

*** Problem A5

    If a sampling distribution of the mean had an SEM equal to 0.0, what would
    this suggest about the sample means drawn from the population and about the
    scores in the population?

    The sample means will all be the same and scores will be infinity.

*** Problem A6

    Compute the mean, the standard deviation, and the estimated standard error
    of the mean for the following sample data: 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5,
    5, 6, 6, 6, 7, and 7.

#+begin_src R
> mean(data)
[1] 5

> sd(data)
[1] 1.21

> sd(data) / sqrt(length(data) - 1)
[1] 0.313
#+end_src

*** Problem A7

    Population A and Population B both have a mean height of 70.0 inches with an
    SD of 6.0. A random sample of 30 people is selected from Population A, and a
    random sample of 50 people is selected from Population B. Which sample mean
    will probably yield a more accurate estimate of its population mean? Why?

#+begin_src R
> 6 / sqrt(30)
[1] 1.1

> 6 / sqrt(50)
[1] 0.849
#+end_src

*** Problem A8

    Suppose we obtained data on vein size after application of a nitroglycerin
    ointment in a sample of 60 patients. The mean vein size is found to be 7.8
    mm with an SD of 2.5. Using the t distribution, what are the confidence
    limits for a 95% CI around the mean? What are the confidence limits for a
    99% CI?

#+begin_src R
> 7.8 + qt(0.025, 60) * 2.5 / sqrt(60)
[1] 7.15

> 7.8 + qt(0.975, 60) * 2.5 / sqrt(60)
[1] 8.45

> 7.8 + qt(0.005, 60) * 2.5 / sqrt(60)
[1] 6.94

> 7.8 + qt(0.995, 60) * 2.5 / sqrt(60)
[1] 8.66

*** Problem A9

    Suppose you wanted to test the hypothesis that the average speed on a
    highway where the maximum legal speed is 55 mph is not equal to 55 mph
    (i.e., H0: mu=55; H1: mu!=55). Speed guns are used to measure the speed of
    50 drivers, and the mean is found to be 57.0, SD=8.0. What is the
    calculated value of t for a one sample t test? With a alpha=.05 for a
    two-tailed test, is the sample mean of 57.0 significantly different from the
    hypothesized mean of 55.0 (i.e., can the null hypothesis be rejected)?

    Fail to reject the null hypothesis because ~1.77 > 2.01~
#+begin_src R
> (57 - 55) / (8 / sqrt(50))
[1] 1.77

> qt(0.975, 50 - 1)
[1] 2.01
#+end_src

*** Problem A10

    For the problem in Question A9, would the obtained re- sult be statistically
    significant with alpha=.05 for a one-tailed test (i.e., for H1: m 55)?

    Yes.

#+begin_src R
> qt(0.95, 50 - 1)
