*** Problem A1

    The following data designate whether or not patients com- plied with a
    medication regimen (1=yes, 2=no), for an experimental group that
    participated in a special intervention designed to promote perceived
    mastery over health events, and a "usual care" control group:

#+begin_src R
experimental <- c(1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2)
control <- c(2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2)

data <- rbind(
  data.frame(type = rep("experimental", length(experimental)), complied = experimental),
  data.frame(type = rep("control", length(control)), complied = control)
)

data$complied <- ifelse(data$complied == 1, "No", "Yes")
data$complied <- factor(data$complied, levels = c("Yes", "No"))
data$type <- factor(data$type, levels = c("experimental", "control"))

    (a) Are the percentages shown in this table row percentages or column
    percentages?

    Column percentages.

    (b) Compute the percentages the opposite way, and then answer this question:
    Given that males represent 7.5% of all licensed nurses in Missouri, which
    (if any) infractions in the table were committed by males at a rate lower
    than their representation among nurses in that state?

#+begin_src R
row_percent <- prop.table(mytable, 1)

> row_percent[row_percent[, "males"] < 0.075, ]
                                        males females

Providing care without physician order 0.0714  0.9286
#+end_src
    
    (c) Based on the recomputed percentages in Exercise A2b, for which
    infraction were male nurses most notably overrepresented?

#+begin_src R
max_idx <- which.max(row_percent[, "females"])

> names(max_idx)

*** Problem A3

    The contingency table below presents fictitious data regarding an
    intervention to reduce pressure ulcers in nursing home residents. Using
    these data, compute ARE, ARNE, ARR, RR, RRR, OR, and NNT.

#+begin_src R
## Absolute Risk (Exposure):
> prop.table(mytable, 1)["Control", "Ulcer"]
[1] 0.3

## Absolute Risk (Non-Exposure):
> prop.table(mytable, 1)["Experimental", "Ulcer"]
[1] 0.1

## Absolute Risk Reduction
arr <- prop.table(mytable, 1)["Control", "Ulcer"] - prop.table(mytable, 1)["Experimental", "Ulcer"]
> arr
[1] 0.2

## Relative Risk
> prop.table(mytable, 1)["Control", "Ulcer"] / prop.table(mytable, 1)["Experimental", "Ulcer"]
[1] 3

## Relative Risk Reduction
> arr / prop.table(mytable, 1)["Experimental", "Ulcer"
[1] 2

## Odds Ratio
odds_exposed <- mytable["Control", "Ulcer"] / mytable["Control", "NoUlcer"]
odds_nonexposed <- mytable["Experimental", "Ulcer"] / mytable["Experimental", "NoUlcer"]
odds_ratio <- odds_exposed / odds_nonexposed
> odds_ratio

## Numbers to Treat

*** Problem A4

    Below are values for diastolic and systolic blood pressure for 10 people.
    Construct a scatterplot that shows the relationship between the variables.
    Verbally describe the direction and magnitude of the relationship.

#+begin_src R
diastolic <- c(90, 80, 90, 78, 76, 78, 80, 70, 76, 74)
systolic <- c(130, 126, 140, 118, 114, 112, 120, 110, 114, 116)

plot(diastolic, systolic)

*** Problem A5

    Compute the correlation coefficient (Pearsonâ€™s r) to summarize the
    relationship for the blood pressure data presented in question A4. How
    accurate was your verbal description of the scatterplot, as compared to the
    value of the coefficient?

#+begin_src R
> cor(diastolic, systolic)
[1] 0.909
