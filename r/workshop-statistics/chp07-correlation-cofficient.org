   This example illustrates the very important distinction between association
   and causation. Two variables may be strongly associated (as measured by the
   correlation coefficient) without a cause- and-effect relationship existing
   between them. Often the explanation is that both variables are re- lated to a
   third variable not being measured; this variable is often called a lurking or
   confounding variable.

** Activity 7-3: High School Completion Rates

   High school completion rate vs distance from Canada.

#+begin_src R
  myfile <- "./data/chp07-school.rds"
  mydata <- readRDS(myfile)

    main = "High School Rate vs Distance",
    xlab = "Distance from Canada",
    ylab = "High School Completion Rate"
  )

  > cor(mydata$Completion.Rate, mydata$Distance)

** Activity 7-11: Climatic Conditions

   The following table lists a number of climatic variables for a sample of 25
   American cities. These variables measure long-term averages of:

| Jan.hi  | January high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) |
| Jan.lo  | January low temperature                          |
| July.hi | July high temperature                            |
| July.lo | July low temperature                             |
| precip  | annual precipitation (in inches)                 |
| precday | days of measurable precipitation per year        |
| snow    | annual snow accumulation                         |
| sun     | percentage of sunshine                           |

** Wrap-Up

   In this topic you have discovered the very important correlation coefficient
   as a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. You have
   derived some of the properties of this measure, such as the values it can
   assume, how its sign and value relate to the direction and strength of the
   association, and its lack of resistance to outliers. You have also practiced
   judging the direction and strength of a relationship from looking at a
   scatterplot. In addition, you have discovered the distinction between
   correlation and causation and learned that one needs to be very careful about
   inferring causal relationships between variables based solely on a strong
   correlation.
