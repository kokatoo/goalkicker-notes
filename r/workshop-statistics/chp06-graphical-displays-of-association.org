  If we knew the temperature in Ohio for a particular day, could we accurately
  predict the temperature in North Carolina?

#+begin_src R
  myfile <- "./data/chp06-weather.rds"
  mydata <- readRDS(myfile)

  plot(mydata$Ohio, mydata$NorthCarolina,
       xlab="Ohio", ylab="North Carolina",
       main="North Carolina vs Ohio Temperature (F)")
#+end_src

** Activity 6-1: Carsâ€™ Fuel Efficiency (cont.)                                                                                        

#+begin_src R
myfile <- "./data/chp06-mpg.rds"
mydata <- readRDS(myfile)

plot(mydata$weight, mydata$mpg,
     xlab="weight", ylab="mpg",
     main="MPG vs Weight")
#+end_src

   The concept of association is an example of a statistical tendency. It is not
   always the case that a heavier car is less fuel efficient, but heavier cars
   certainly do tend to be.

** Activity 6-5: Space Shuttle O-Ring Failures

#+begin_src R
myfile <- "./data/chp06-oring.rds"
mydata <- readRDS(myfile)

names(mydata) <- c("date", "failures", "temp")

plot(mydata$temp, mydata$failures,
     xlab="Temperature", ylab="O'Ring Failures",
     main="O'Ring Failures vs Temperature")

mydata <- mydata[mydata$failures > 0,]
plot(mydata$temp, mydata$failures,
     xlab="Temperature", ylab="O'Ring Failures",
     main="O'Ring Failures vs Temperature")
#+end_src

   Excluding 0 failures:

   As we can see from the plot, there is no discernable relationship after
   excluding 0 failures datapoints.

** Wrap-Up

   This topic has introduced you to an area that occupies a prominent role in
   statistical practice: exploring relationships between variables. You have
   discovered the concept of association and learned how to construct and to
   interpret scatterplots and labeled scatterplots as visual displays of
   association.
