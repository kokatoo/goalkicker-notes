* Chapter 1: Data and Variables

** Introduction

  There are different reasons for collecting data. One reason is to gain an
  understanding of the data by organizing and graphing the individual values.
  Another is to draw conclusions about a larger group of information.

** Preliminaries

   Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization,
   analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.

** Activity 1-1: Types of Variables

   Data is typically collected from a number of people or things. We define a
   variable to be some characteristic that can be assigned a number (discrete or
   continous) or a category. The thing which is assigned the number or category
   is called the case or observational unit. In the “states visited” example
   above, the students in this class are the cases of interest.

   In this book, we will distinguish between two different types of variables. A
   categorical variable is a characteristic of an individual which can be
   broken down into different classes or categories. A measurement variable is a
   number associated with an individual that is obtained by means of some
   measurement. Examples of a measurement variable include your age, your
   height.

   As the term variable suggests, the values assumed by a variable differ from
   case to case. In other words, data display variability. The pattern of this
   variability is called the distribution of the variable. Much of the practice
   of statistics concerns distributions of variables, from displaying them
   visually to summarizing them numerically to describing them verbally.

** Wrap-up

   You have encountered two very important concepts in this topic that will be
   central to the entire course: variability and distribution. You have also
   learned to distinguish between measurement and categorical variables. You
   have discovered two simple techniques for producing such displays: bar graphs
   for categorical variables and dotplots for measurement variables.
