* Chapter 5: Comparing Distributions

** Comparing Groups Using Boxplots

   Suppose that we are interested in comparing the lengths of songs on the
   Beatles’ three albums “Rubber Soul”, “Sergeant Pepper”, and “The White Album”
   that were released in the years 1966, 1967 and 1968, respectively.

#+begin_src R
  mylist <- list(RubberSoul=c(150, 126, 202, 165, 139, 164, 162,
                              171, 154, 147, 148, 137, 144, 139),
                 SergeantPepper=c(119, 166, 205, 167, 153, 204,
                                  156, 303, 158, 163, 155, 80, 303),
                 TheWhiteAlbum=c(165, 240, 130, 190, 62, 185, 286,
                                 167, 148, 121, 140, 124, 213, 232,
                                 102, 106, 177, 160, 241, 166, 145,
                                 195, 270, 188, 253, 162, 175, 191,
                                 495, 194))

  mydata <- melt(mylist)
  names(mydata) <- c("duration", "album")

  boxplot(duration ~ album, data=mydata,
          horizontal=TRUE, main="Beatles Album")
#+end_src

** Statistical Tendency

   Men tend to be taller than women, but there are certainly some women who are
   taller than most men. Statistical tendencies pertain to average or typical
   cases but not necessarily to individual cases.

** Activity 5-2: Professional Golfers’ Winnings

   The following data presents the winnings (in thousands of dollars) of the 30
   highest money winners on each of the three professional golf tours (PGA for
   males, LPGA for females, and Seniors for males over 50 years of age) in 1990.

#+begin_src R
  myfile <- "./data/chp05-golf.rds"
  mydata <- readRDS(myfile)

  boxplot(winnings ~ tournament, data=mydata, main="Golf Tournaments")
#+end_src

** Activity 5-7: Automobile Theft Rates

   Investigate whether states in the eastern or western part of the U.S. tend to
   have higher rates of motor vehicle thefts. The following data divides states
   according to whether they lie east or west of the Mississippi River and lists
   their 1990 rate of automobile thefts per 100,000 residents.

#+begin_src R
  myfile <- "./data/chp05-theft.rds"
  mydata <- readRDS(myfile)

  boxplot(theft ~ region, data=mydata,
          main="US Theft Rate Per 100,000 (1990)")
#+end_src

** Activity 5-15: Mutual Funds’ Returns

   Mutual funds are collections of stocks and bonds which have become a very
   popular investment option in recent years. Some funds require the buyer to
   pay a fee called a ”load” which is similar to a commission charge. A natural
   question to ask is whether funds that require a load charge perform better
   than funds which require no load. The data lists the 1993 percentage return
   for the mutual funds of the Fidelity Investment group:

#+begin_src R
  mylist <- list(NoLoad=c(13.9, 17.8, 21.9, 12.4, 22.1, 15.4, 13.9, 12.5, 9, 9.1,
                          23.3, 36.7, 13.1, 13.1, 5.2, 26.3, 81.8, 13.9, 6.7, 13.1,
                          19.3, 21.3, 11.2, 13.2, 14, 13.8, 18.9, 35.1, 12.9, 19.1,
                          13.6, 9.8, 16.2, 12.8, 10.2, 25.5, 6.5, 20.5, 12.6, 15.6,
                          25.9, 18.4, 12.2, 21.4, 22.9, 8.1, 5.5, 13.8, 12.5, 36.5),
                 Load=c(24.5, 19.5, 33.4, 20.2, 21.4, 24.7, 26.4, 24.7, 26.8, 8.3,
                        19.9, 40.1, 27.2, 63.9, 16.2, 21.1))

  mydata <- melt(mylist)
  names(mydata) <- c("return", "type")

  boxplot(return ~ type, data=mydata, notch=TRUE,
          main="Mutual Funds % Return (1993)")
#+end_src

** Activity 5-16: Star Trek Episodes

   Editors of an Entertainment Weekly publication ranked every episode of Star
   Trek: The Next Gener- ation from best (rank 1) to worst (rank 178).

#+begin_src R
  myfile <- "./data/chp05-star-trek.rds"
  mydata <- readRDS(myfile)
  mydata <- melt(mydata)
  names(mydata) <- c("season", "rank")
  mydata <- mydata[!is.na(mydata$rank),]

  boxplot(rank ~ season, data=mydata,
          horizontal=TRUE, cex.axis=0.7,
          xlab="Ranking", ylab="Season",
          main="Star Trek Episode Ranking")
#+end_src

** Wrap-Up

   You have been introduced in this topic to methods of comparing distributions
   between/among two or more groups. This task has led you to the very important
   concept of statistical tendencies. You have also expanded your knowledge of
   visual displays of distributions by encountering side-by- side stemplots and
   modified boxplots.
