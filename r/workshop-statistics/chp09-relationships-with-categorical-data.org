* Chapter 9: Relationships with Categorical Variables

  We can learn about the relationship between two categorical variables by means
  of a *two-way table*. Although the two-way table can be used to learn about
  the marginal totals of each variable, it is most useful in learning about the
  relationship or the association between the two variables. To understand the
  association in a two-way table, we compute conditional proportions in the
  table.

  Marginal and conditional distributions can be found the same table. Marginal
  distributions are the totals for the probabilities. They are found in the
  margins (that’s why they are called “marginal”). The total probabilities in
  the margins are the marginal distributions. A conditional distribution on this
  table would be a sub-population. Given two jointly distributed random
  variables, they deal with finding the probability for one random variable
  given certain restrictions for the other random variable.

** Activity 9-4: Hypothetical Hospital Recovery Rates

#+begin_src R
  mytable <- matrix(c(800, 900, 200, 100), 2, 2)
  rownames(mytable) <- c("hospitalA", "hospitalB")
  colnames(mytable) <- c("survived", "died")
  mytable <- as.table(mytable)
  > mytable
            survived died
  hospitalA      800  200
  hospitalB      900  100

  > addmargins(prop.table(mytable, 1), 2)
            survived died Sum
  hospitalA      0.8  0.2 1.0
  hospitalB      0.9  0.1 1.0

  good_cond <- matrix(c(590, 870, 10, 30), 2, 2)
  rownames(good_cond) <- c("hospitalA", "hospitalB")
  colnames(good_cond) <- c("survived", "died")
  good_cond <- as.table(good_cond)
  > good_cond
            survived died
  hospitalA      590   10
  hospitalB      870   30

  > addmargins(prop.table(good_cond, 1), 2)
            survived died  Sum
  hospitalA     0.98 0.02 1.00
  hospitalB     0.97 0.03 1.00

  bad_cond <- matrix(c(210, 30, 190, 70), 2, 2)
  rownames(bad_cond) <- c("hospitalA", "hospitalB")
  colnames(bad_cond) <- c("survived", "died")
  mytable <- as.table(bad_cond)
  > mytable
            survived died
  hospitalA      210  190
  hospitalB       30   70

  > addmargins(prop.table(bad_cond, 1), 2)
            survived died Sum
  hospitalA      0.5  0.5   1
  hospitalB      0.3  0.7   1

  > good_cond + bad_cond
            survived died
  hospitalA      800  200
  hospitalB      900  100
#+end_src

   The phenomenon that you have just discovered is called Simpson’s paradox,
   which refers to the fact that aggregate proportions can reverse the direction
   of the relationship seen in the individual pieces. In this case, hospital B
   has the higher recovery rate overall, yet hospital A has the higher recovery
   for each type of patient.

   This happens because hospital B admits more good condition patients and they
   tend to survive more.

** Activity 9-5: Hypothetical Employee Retention Predictions

   Suppose that an organization is concerned about the number of its new
   employees who leave the company before they finish one year of work. In an
   effort to predict whether a new employee will leave or stay, they develop a
   standardized test and apply it to 100 new employees. After one year, they
   note what the test had predicted (stay or leave) and whether the employee
   actually stayed or left.

#+begin_src R
  rownames(mytable) <- c("predicted to stay", "predicted to leave")
  colnames(mytable) <- c("actually stays", "actually leaves")
  mytable <- as.table(mytable)
  > addmargins(mytable)
                     actually stays actually leaves Sum
  predicted to stay              63              12  75
  predicted to leave             21               4  25
  Sum                            84              16 100

  > addmargins(prop.table(mytable, 1), 2)
                     actually stays actually leaves Sum
  predicted to stay             0.8             0.2 1.0
  predicted to leave            0.8             0.2 1.0

  barplot(t(prop.table(mytable, 1)),
    main = "Segmented bar graph of political ideology data",
    ylab = "Percentage",
    legend = colnames(mytable)
  )

** Wrap-Up

   With this topic we have concluded our investigation of relationships between
   variables. This topic has differed from earlier ones in that it has dealt
   exclusively with categorical variables. The most important technique that
   this topic has covered has involved interpreting information presented in
   two-way tables. You have encountered the ideas of marginal distributions and
   conditional distributions, and you have learned to draw bar graphs and
   segmented bar graphs to display these distribu- tions. Finally, you have
   discovered and explained the phenomenon known as Simpson’s Paradox, which
   raises interesting issues with regard to analyzing two-way tables.
