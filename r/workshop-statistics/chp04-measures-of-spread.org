* Chapter 4: Measures of Spread

** The Quartiles and the Quartile Spread

   Recall the interpretation of the median M . It was the value which divided
   the data into two halves â€“ half of the measurements were smaller than M and
   half were larger than M . Suppose we take this division idea one step
   further. We divide the smaller half of the measurements into two halves, and
   likewise divide the larger half of the measurements into two halves. The two
   new division values are called the *quartiles*. The distance between the two
   quartiles is the *quartile spread*, which is a measure of spread of the
   dataset.

   What is the meaning of the quartiles and the quartile spread QS?
   Approximately one quarter of the measurements are smaller than the lower
   quartile QL and approximately one quarter of the data values are larger than
   the upper quartile QU.
   
** The Five-number Summary
   
   A useful set of summary numbers for a group of measurements is the median M ,
   the lower and upper quartiles QL and QU , and the smallest and largest
   measurements, which we denote by LO and HI. The five-numbers written in
   ascending order (LO, QL , M, QU , HI) is called a five-number summary.
   
   One graphical display of a distribution known as the boxplot is based on this
   five-number summary. To construct a boxplot, one draws a box between the
   quartiles, thus indicating where the middle 50% of the data fall. Horizontal
   lines called whiskers are then extended from the middle of the sides of the
   box to the minimum and to the maximum. The median is then marked with a
   vertical line inside the box.

** Activity 4-2: Supreme Court Service (cont.)

#+begin_src R
  myfile <- "./data/chp03-justice.rds"
  mydata <- readRDS(file=myfile)

  > summary(mydata$tenure)
     Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    0.000   3.000   6.000   8.444  13.000  22.000 

  boxplot(mydata$tenure, main="Supreme Court Justice Tenure", xlab="Years")

** The Standard Deviation

   What if we used as our measure of spread the arithmetic average of these
   deviations from the mean? The squared values of the deviations provide a more
   useful notion of spread. The measurements that are close to the mean will have
   a small squared deviation and the measurement that are far from the mean will
   have a large positive squared deviation.

** Activity 4-5: Placement Exam Scores

              32,17,21,12,16,8,4,7,5,4)

  mydata <- c()
  for(i in 1:length(scores)) {
    mydata <- c(mydata, rep(scores[i], counts[i]))
  }

** Measure of Relative Standing

   Suppose that we are given some measurement data. One way of measuring the
   relative standing of a particular measurement is based on the mean and
   standard deviation of the dataset. The z-score of the measurement X, denoted
   by z, is found by subtracting the mean from the measurement and then dividing
   by the standard deviation. When we subtract the mean from the measurement, we
   are seeing how far the measurement is from the mean. By dividing this
   quantity by the standard deviation, we are converting this distance from the
   mean to standard deviation units.
