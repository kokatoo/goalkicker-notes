* Chapter 2: Displaying and Describing Distributions

** Basic features of a data distribution

   * The *center* of a distribution is usually the most important aspect to notice
   and describe.

   * A distribution’s *variability* is a second important feature. How spread out
     are the data?

   * The shape of a distribution can reveal much information. By shape, we are
     referring to a general statement how the data values are distributed.

     * A distribution is *symmetric* if one half is roughly a mirror image of the
       other.

     * A distribution is *skewed to the right* if there is a cluster of values at
       the left and the values trail off much farther to the right than to left.

     * A distribution is *skewed to the left* if there  is a cluster of values on
       the right and the values trail off much farther to the left than to the
       right.

   * A distribution may have *peaks* or *clusters* which indicate that the data fall
     into natural subgroups.

   * *Outliers*, observations which differ markedly from the pattern established
     by the vast majority, often arise and warrant close examination.

   * A distribution may display *granularity* if its values occur only at fixed
     intervals (such as multiples of 5 or 10).

** Variations of stemplots

   To illustrate some alternative methods of constructing stemplots, suppose
   that I am thinking about buying a house. I read the real estate section of
   the paper and note that many of the houses will be open for inspection over
   the weekend. How expensive are these homes? I jot down the selling prices of
   23 homes that will be open. The prices are in thousands of dollars.

#+begin_src R
  mydata <- data.frame(price=c(94, 98, 104, 115, 239, 159, 142,
              179, 54, 145, 119, 199, 149, 69,
              375, 215, 145, 78, 64, 126, 121,
              94, 79))
  mydata
  ggplot(mydata, aes(x=price)) + geom_dotplot() +
    labs(title="House Prices") +
    theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))

  # note that the values are rounded up
  stem(mydata$price, scale=2)
  > The decimal point is 2 digit(s) to the right of the |

    0 | 5678899
    1 | 0022234

** Histograms

   To demonstrate the construction of a histogram, we will work with a larger
   set of house selling prices. From the newspaper, I see an ad for one of the
   larger realty companies in the city. The prices (in thousands of dollars) for
   all of the houses listed for sale for this company.

#+begin_src R
  numbins = 12
  histdata <- hist(mydata$price, numbins, xlab="Price", main="House Prices")
  intervals <- cbind((histdata$breaks+1)[-(numbins+1)], histdata$breaks[-1])

  data.frame(interval=paste("(", paste(intervals[,1], intervals[,2], sep="-"), ")", sep=""),
             count=histdata$counts,
             proportion=round(histdata$counts/sum(histdata$counts), 2))
  >   interval count proportion
  1     (1-50)     3       0.03
  2   (51-100)    31       0.30
  3  (101-150)    39       0.38
  4  (151-200)    15       0.14
  5  (201-250)     9       0.09
  6  (251-300)     4       0.04
  7  (301-350)     1       0.01
  8  (351-400)     0       0.00
  9  (401-450)     1       0.01
  10 (451-500)     0       0.00
  11 (501-550)     0       0.00
  12 (551-600)     1       0.01
