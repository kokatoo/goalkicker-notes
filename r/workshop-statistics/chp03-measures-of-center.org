* Topic 3: Measures of Center

** Two averages – the mean and the median

   There are two averages that are commonly used in summarizing data — the *mean*
   and the *median*. The mean is the well-known arithmetic average that is
   obtained by finding the sum of the measurements and dividing the sum by the
   number of data items. The median is the number which divides the data in
   half; half of the measurements are smaller than the median and half are
   larger.

   The median M is said to be a resistant measure since it is resistant
   or not affected by extreme observations. The incorrect large sugar
   measurement of Smacks had no impact on the value of the median. In contrast,
   the mean x̄ can be affected by a single extreme observation. The mean is an
   example of a summary measure which is sensitive or nonresistant to extreme
   data values.

   The median of an odd number of observations can be found in position
   ~(n+1)/2~ (once the values are arranged in order), while the median of an n
   even number of observations is the mean of those occupying positions ~n/2~
   and ~n/2 + 1~.

** Wrap-Up

   You have learned that these statistics measure only one aspect of a
   distribution and that you must combine these numerical measures with what you
   already know about displaying distributions visually and describing them
   verbally.
