** Activity 8-10: Basketball Rookie Salaries

   The dataset pertains to basketball players selected in the first round of
   the 1991 National Basketball Association draft. It lists the draft number
   (the order in which the player was selected) of each player and the annual
   salary of the contract that the player signed. The two missing entries are
   for players who signed with European teams.

#+begin_src R
  myfile <- "./data/chp07-nba.rds"
  mydata <- readRDS(myfile)

  plot(mydata$pick, mydata$salary,
    xlab = "Pick #", ylab = "Salary"
  )

  fit <- lm(salary ~ pick, data = mydata)

  > summary(fit)$r.squared

  > predict(fit, data.frame(pick = 12))

** Wrap-Up

   This topic has led you to study a formal mathematical model for describing
   the relationship between two variables. In studying least squares regression,
   you have encountered a variety of related terms and concepts. These ideas
   include the use of regression in prediction, the danger of extrapolation, the
   interpretation of the slope coefficient, the concepts of fitted values and
   residuals, and the interpretation of r 2 as the proportion of variability
   explained by the regression line. Understanding all of these ideas is
   important to applying regression techniques thoughtfully and appropriately.
