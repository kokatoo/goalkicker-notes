* Chapter 50: Color script output (cross-platform)

** Section 50.1: color-output.sh

   In the opening section of a bash script, it's possible to define some
   variables that function as helpers to color or otherwise format the terminal
   output during the run of the script.

   Different platforms use different character sequences to express color.
   However, there's a utility called ~tput~ which works on all *nix systems and
   returns platform-specific terminal coloring strings via a consistent
   cross-platform API.

   For example, to store the character sequence which turns the terminal text
   red or green:

#+begin_src bash
  red=$(tput setaf 1)
  green=$(tput setaf 2)
#+end_src

   Or, to store the character sequence which resets the text to default
   appearance:

#+begin_src bash
  reset=$(tput sgr0)
#+end_src

   Then, if the BASH script needed to show different colored outputs, this can
   be achieved with:

#+begin_src bash
  cho "${green}Success!${reset}" echo "${red}Failure.${reset}"
#+end_src
