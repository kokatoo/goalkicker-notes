** Section 16.1: Copy a single file

   Copy foo.txt from ~/path/to/source/~ to ~/path/to/target/folder/~

#+begin_src bash
  cp /path/to/source/foo.txt /path/to/target/folder/
#+end_src

Copy foo.txt from ~/path/to/source/~ to ~/path/to/target/folder/~ into a file called ~bar.txt~

#+begin_src bash
  cp /path/to/source/foo.txt /path/to/target/folder/bar.txt
#+end_src

** Section 16.2: Copy folders

   copy folder foo into folder bar

#+begin_src bash
  cp -r /path/to/foo /path/to/bar
#+end_src

   if folder bar exists before issuing the command, then foo and its content
   will be copied into the folder bar. However, if bar does not exist before
   issuing the command, then the folder bar will be created and the content of
   foo will be placed into bar
