** Section 4.1: List Files in a Long Listing Format

   The ls command's -l option prints a specified directory's contents in a long
   listing format. If no directory is specified then, by default, the contents of
   the current directory are listed.

   ~ls -l /etc~

   Example Output:

#+begin_src
total 1204
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Apr 21 03:44 acpi 
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3028 Apr 21 03:38 adduser.conf 
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 11 20:42 alternatives
...
#+end_src
   
   The output first displays total, which indicates the total size in blocks of
   all the files in the listed directory. It then displays eight columns of
   information for each file in the listed directory. Below are the details for
   each column in the output:

| Col No. | Example      | Description                 |
|---------+--------------+-----------------------------|
|     1.1 | d            | File type (see table below) |

|       2 | 3            | Number of hard links        |
|       3 | root         | Owner name                  |
|       4 | root         | Owner group                 |
|       5 | 4096         | File size in bytes          |
|       6 | Apr 21 03:44 | Modification time           |
