* Chapter 40: File execution sequence

  ~.bash_profile~, ~.bash_login~, ~.bashrc~, and ~.profile~ all do pretty much
  the same thing: set up and define functions, variables, and the sorts.

  The main difference is that ~.bashrc~ is called at the opening of a non-login
  but interactive window, and ~.bash_profile~ and the others are called for a
  login shell. Many people have their ~.bash_profile~ or similar call .bashrc
  anyway.

** Section 40.1: .profile vs .bash_profile (and .bash_login)

   ~.profile~ is read by most shells on startup, including bash. However,
   ~.bash_profile~ is used for configurations specific to bash. For general
   initialization code, put it in ~.profile~. If it's specific to bash, use
   ~.bash_profile~.

   ~.profile~ isn't actually designed for bash specifically, ~.bash_profile~ is
   though instead. (.profile is for Bourne and other similar shells, which bash
   is based off) Bash will fall back to ~.profile~ if ~.bash_profile~ isn't found.

   ~.bash_login~ is a fallback for ~.bash_profile~, if it isn't found. Generally
   best to use ~.bash_profile~ or ~.profile~ instead.
