* Chapter 60: Select keyword

  Select keyword can be used for getting input argument in a menu format.

** Section 60.1: Select keyword can be used for getting input argument in a menu format

   Suppose you want the user to ~SELECT~ keywords from a menu, we can create a
   script similar to

#+begin_src bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  select os in "linux" "windows" "mac";do
    echo "${os}"
    break
  done
#+end_src

   Explanation:

   Here ~SELECT~ keyword is used to loop through a list of items that will be
   presented at the command prompt for a user to pick from. Notice the ~break~
   keyword for breaking out of the loop once the user makes a choice. Otherwise,
   the loop will be endless!

   Results: Upon running this script, a menu of these items will be displayed
   and the user will be prompted for a selection. Upon selection, the value will
   be displayed, returning back to command prompt.

#+begin_src bash
  >bash select_menu.sh
  1) linux
  2) windows
  3) mac
  #? 3
  mac
  >
#+end_src
