** Section 49.3: Introduction to dot ﬁles

   In Unix, ﬁles and directories beginning with a period usually contain
   settings for a speciﬁc program/a series of programs. Dot ﬁles are usually
   hidden from the user, so you would need to run ~ls -a~ to see them.

   An example of a dot ﬁle is [[http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/145254][.bash_history]], which contains the latest executed
   commands, assuming the user is using Bash.

   There are various ﬁles that are [[http://superuser.com/a/46146][sourced]] when you are dropped into the Bash
   shell. The image below, taken from [[http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/BashInitialisationFiles.html][this site]], shows the decision process
   behind choosing which ﬁles to source at startup.
