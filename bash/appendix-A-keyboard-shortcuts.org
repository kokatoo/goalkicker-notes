** Section A.1: Editing Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Description                                                                         |
|----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-a      | move to the beginning of the line                                                   |
| C-e      | move to the end of the line                                                         |
| C-k      | Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.              |
| C-u      | Kill the text from the current cursor position to the beginning of the line         |
| C-w      | Kill the word behind the current cursor position                                    |
| M-b      | move backward one word                                                              |
| M-f      | move forward one word                                                               |
| C-M-e    | shell expand line                                                                   |
| C-y      | Yank the most recently killed text back into the buï¬€er at the cursor.               |
| M-y      | Rotate through killed text. You can only do this if the prior command is C-y or M-y |

   Killing text will delete text, but save it so that the user can reinsert it
   by yanking. Similar to cut and paste except that the text is placed on a kill
   ring which allows for storing more than one set of text to be yanked back on
   to the command line.

   You can find out more in the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#The-Kill-Ring][emacs manual]].
